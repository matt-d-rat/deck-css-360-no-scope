##  What are CSS Modules?

> A CSS Module is a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.
> CSS Modules compile to a low-level interchange format called ICSS or [Interoperable CSS](https://github.com/css-modules/icss), but are written like normal CSS files.
