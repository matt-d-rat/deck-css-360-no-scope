##  So why is this important?

The use of encapsulation or scoping allows us to shape our application architecture by:

<ul>
    <li class="fragment">Restricting access to some of the components implementation, allowing us to define a clear interface</li>
    <li class="fragment">Facilitate the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) operating on that data</li>
    <li class="fragment">Avoid namespace collisions or accidentally overriding another part of the application by a later declaration</li>
</ul>
