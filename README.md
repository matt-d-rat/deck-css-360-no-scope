So you've mastered gradients, you're a media query ninja, and you know every trick, hack and workaround in the CSS playbook. But still you feel like CSS is missing something, something very important, and ultimately fundamental in allowing your app to scale. That thing is local scope. When building large scale web applications, scope is essential to achieving encapsulation and a clean separation of concerns. But CSS as a language is missing this key ingredient. So what can we do?

In this talk Matt walks through some of the recent innovations that have emerged from the community that allow us to achieve local scope in CSS today, and will demonstrate how to get your project up and running with Webpack to achieve local scope in CSS.
